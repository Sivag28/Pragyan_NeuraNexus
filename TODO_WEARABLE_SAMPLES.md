# Plan: Add More Wearable Sample Data

## Information Gathered:
- Current implementation has only ONE static sample in `loadSampleWearableData()` function
- User wants more sample data options for the wearable feature

## Plan:
- [ ] Add an array of multiple wearable sample data in static/js/script.js
- [ ] Modify loadSampleWearableData() to cycle through samples
- [ ] Add Next/Previous buttons for navigation

## Followup steps:
- [ ] Test the new wearable sample data navigation
